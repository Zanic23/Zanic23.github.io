            JBON 2.0 was created by Jonah Romero during the 2020 Quarentine. The first version of JBON was filled with memory leaks and was unitutive, although
            it could parse extremely quickly. In this version, the efficency was heavily taken into mind, as well as trying to add all the features in JBON.
            Regardless, there was no parsing library for c++ that did what I wanted, so here it is in all its glory, JBON 2.0. Feel free to send me any comments, 
            criticisms or suggestions that you might have. I think this is a cool project, and I'd love to try and 
            make as best as possible. So, feel free to email me at jbonlib@gmail.com. Also I have github, so take a look at the source code if you want.
        </p>
