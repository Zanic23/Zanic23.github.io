    <h2>Manipulating Data</h2>
    <h3 id = "ClassCollections">Class Collections</h3>
    <p>
        JBON is all about variables, and all it starts with a class collection. ClassCollections are basically just vectors of GenericClasses, which are the class
        templates you've seen in the examples. ClassCollections can either be made manually by pushing GenericClasses (to manually make a GenericClass, simply pass
        its schema as a string to its constructor), or from a parsing method desribed in the Loading JBON tutorial. *Important Note*. When editing a class collection
        from JBON file, make sure to store it in as reference to a ClassCollection, or else the file cannot save any changes done to it.
    </p>
    <pre><code>
jbon::File file("data.jbon");
jbon::ClassCollection& classes = file.getClasses();
//or
jbon::ClassCollection classes = jbon::parse("...");
//or manually create a ClassCollection
jbon::ClassCollection classes;
classes.push_back( {"monster{ pos, health, strength}"} );
    </code></pre>
    <p>
        The ClassCollection contains all the parsed data. To query a specific class, use bracket notation with its class name. This will return a GenericClass, 
        the classic JBON schema.
    </p>
    <pre><code>
jbon::ClassCollection classes = jbon::parse("Dog{age, strength} Dog(5, 32)");
jbon::GenericClass& dogClass = classes["Dog"];
    </code></pre>
    <h3 id = "GenericClasses">Generic Classes</h3>
    <p>
        GenericClasses are the heart of JBON and everything goes through them. GenericClass has two main utilities, is to create more objects of 
        its type and query for its associated objects. In order to make an object of its a classes' type, either call constructNamedObject or constructObject.
        When serializing the objects, one will resolve to Dog:Name(...), and the other Dog(). Names will be useful, as they can be used to query specific objects. 
        For either of these functions, simply pass a valid JBON type. Both of these functions will return a reference to the object it created.
    </p>
    <pre><code>
jbon::GenericClass& dogClass = classes["Dog"];
//adding new objects to the dog class
dogClass.constructNamedObject("Scruffles", 4, 28);
dogClass.constructObject(2, 11);
//query all constructed objects associated with the dog class
jbon::ObjectCollection& associatedObjects = dogClass.getObjects();
    </code></pre>
    <h3 id = "ObjectCollections">Object Collections</h3>
    <p>
        The other use of the GenericClass is, of course, to get its associated objects. This is sent as an ObjectCollection. ObjectCollections can query for a specific 
        named object with bracket notation. The ObjectCollections also have defined iterators, so looping through all the objects is quite simple, and can also be used
        to delete specific elements.
    </p>
    <pre><code>
jbon::ObjectCollection& associatedObjects = dogClass.getObjects();
//Can query a specific object
associatedObjects["Scruffles"];
//has defined iterators for looping through all objects
for(auto& object : associatedObjects){
    //...
}
auto it = associatedObjects.find("Scruffles");
associatedObjects.erase(it);
    </code></pre>
    <h3 id = "ClassObjects">Class Objects</h3>
    <p>
        ClassObjects are more restrictive than conventional JBON objects, because they have to follow the schema provided by the GenericClass. So, the ClassObjects can
        only change what the values at their keys are; they cannot add, or delete fields. There's two functions to change values at a key, set() and at().
        set() is used when you want to change value at a key, but to a different type. at() is used when you simply want to change the value to another of the same type.
    </p>
    <pre><code>
        /*Scruffles Before
            Dog:Scruffles(4,28)
        */

        jbon::ClassObject& scruffles = associatedObjects["Scruffles"];
        scruffles.at&ltint&gt("age") = 20;
        scruffles.set("strength", "This dog has no strength");

        /*Scruffles After
            Dog:Scruffles(20, "This dog has no strength")
        */
    </code></pre>
