    <h2>Loading JBON</h2>

    <p>
        In JBON there are two ways to parse text. You can either open up a file with JBON text, or use the parser to parse a string. To start, let's begin talking about 
        opening a file. All JBON files are proceeded with the .jbon file extension. To load a file, either call a JBON file constructor with the filepath, or load 
        the data at a later time.
    </p>
    <pre><code>
jbon::File file("test.jbon")
//or 
jbon::File file();
file.load("test.jbon");
    </code></pre>
    <p>
        As you can see, everything in the JBON library is under the jbon namespace, so for convenience sake, using the namespace would not be a bad idea. JBON files 
        can also include JBON files, which is different than loading them. Think about it like a C++ header that you're including. If you find yourself often copying 
        the same class definition, you can define the class in a JBON file once and include it in any other file loading. This was added to reduce redundancy, so 
        don't hesitate to use it. Also, keep in mind, including a JBON file will only look at the classes and not load the data.
    </p>
    <pre><code>
jbon::File file;
file.include("CatHeader.jbon");
file.load("CatData.jbon");
    </code></pre>
    <h3 id = "ParsingText">Parsing Text</h3>
    <p>
        The other way to parse JBON text is to use the parse function. Pass the text you want parsed and it will return a ClassCollection.
    </p>
    <pre><code>
auto collection = jbon::parse("Coord{x, y} Coord(4,2)");
    </code></pre>
    <h3 id = "SavingData">Saving Data</h3>
    <p>
        The only data that can be saved to a file is data opened with a JBON file. The user, however, can save any data manually with the serialize functions provided
        by nearly all classes. To save data opened with JBON file, simply call save().
    </p>
    <pre><code>
jbon::File file;
file.load("data.jbon");
auto& collection = file.getClassess();
//change the data refrenced by the collection
file.save();
    </code></pre>
