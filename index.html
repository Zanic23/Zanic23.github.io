            JBON is a C++ file parsing library developed to easily create abstract types for saving and loading data.
        </p>

        <ul id = "CodeExamples">
            <li class = "Text">
                <p>
                Here is a basic example of a formatted JBON file. There's a class describing its keys/variables.<br>
                Following the class are its constructed objects. Keep in mind the class definition does not need to proceed the Objects.
                </p>
                <pre>
                    <code class = "c++">
Dog {
    name,
    age,
    owner
}
Dog("Scruffles", 4, "Jonah")
Dog("Lily", 4, "Izzy")
                    </code>
                </pre>
            </li>
            <li class = "Text">
                <p>
                One of JBON's great features, not found in many file parsing systems, is the ability to <br>define your own custom type.
                While the basic types in JBON include float, int, bool, and string,<br> JBON also provides its own standard custom types Object, Array, and Pair.
                </p>
                <pre>
                    <code class = "c++">
Party {
    location,
    couples
}
Party( {x = 4, y = 3}, [&ltJohn, Penny&gt, &ltMarry, Joe&gt])
                    </code>
                </pre>
            </li>
            <li class = "Text">
                <p>
                An important feature of JBON is that there is no requirement for the types 
                <br>each object is constructed with. The following example is completely valid JBON.
                </p>
                <pre>
                    <code class = "c++">
Mouse {
    position,
    click
}
Mouse({x = 2, y = 3}, true)
Mouse({x = 2, y = 3}, "Nope")
Mouse({x = 2, y = 3}, 324)
                    </code>
                </pre>
            </li>
            <li class = "Text">
                <p>
                JBON objects are also capable of having names for querying. 
                <br>Simply put a colon followed by the object's name infront of its class name.
                </p>
                <pre>
                    <code class = "c++">
Button {
    position,
    color,
    text
}
Button:MainMenu( {x = 3, y = 10}, { r = 32, g = 34, b = 22}, "Play")

        <p class = "Text">JBON, while feature rich, is fully capable of parsing and loading your files very quickly. Listed are the 
            parsing and saving times for serialized c++ class, called Pos, containing two variables, x and y. If you look closely
            at the saving times, you'll see a jump in the times required to save. This is simply due to the the caching limit on your computer, but overall
            its times are still fast. Also keep in mind, the y-axis is measured in microseconds. To convert microseconds to milliseconds, divide by a thousand.
