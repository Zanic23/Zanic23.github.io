            This website includes plentiful documentation for how to use the library.

                Here is a basic example of a formatted JBON file. There's a class describing its keys/variables.<br> 
                Following the class are its constructed objects. Keep in mind the class definition does not need to proceed the Objects.

                    <code class = "c++">
Dog {
    name,
    age,
    owner
}
Dog("Scruffles", 4, "Jonah")
Dog("Lily", 4, "Izzy")
                    </code>

            <li class = "Text">
                <p>
                One of JBON's great features, not found in many file parsing systems, is the ability to <br>define your own custom type.
                While the basic types in JBON include: float, int, bool, and string,<br> JBON also provides its own standard custom types Object, Array, and Pair.

                <pre>
                    <code class = "c++">
Party {
    location,
    couples
}
Character( {x = 4, y = 3}, [&ltJohn, Penny&gt, &ltMarry, Joe&gt])
                    </code>
                </pre>
            </li>
            <li class = "Text">
                <p>
                An important feature of JBON is that there is no requirment for the types 
                <br>each object is constructed with. The following example is completely valid JBON.
                </p>
                <pre>
                    <code class = "c++">
Mouse {
    position,
    click
}
Mouse({x = 2, y = 3}, true)
Mouse({x = 2, y = 3}, "Nope")
Mouse({x = 2, y = 3}, 324)
                    </code>
                </pre>

            <li class = "Text">
                <p>
                JBON objetcs are also capable of having names for querying. 
                <br>Simply put a colon followed by the objects name infront of its class name.
