    <h4>Constructors</h4>

    <div class = "Method">
        <h6>File(std::string filepath);</h6>
        <p>Will create a file object, and will parse through the text as the specified filepath.</p>
    </div>
    <div class = "Method">
        <h6>File();</h6>
        <p>Default Constructor.</p>
    </div>
    <h4>Methods</h4>
    <hr>
    <div class = "Method">
        <h6>ClassCollection& getClasses();</h6>
        <p>This will return a refrence to the classes and objects parsed from the file in the form of a ClassCollection.</p>
    </div>
    <div class = "Method">
        <h6>void include(std::string filepath);</h6>
        <p>Including a filepath is slightly different than loading a file. Including it will stictly parse the classes in that file. This is useful if you find yourself constantly
            rewriting the same same class template. Unlike load, which can only be used once per fileObject, you include as many files as you want.
        </p>
    </div>
    <div class = "Method">
        <h6>void load(std::string filepath);</h6>
        <p>This will will load and parse the contents at the designated filepath.</p>
    </div>
    <div class = "Method">
        <h6>void save();</h6>
        <p>Any changes done to the ClassCollection (that can be refrenced with ClassCollection) will be saved in the loaded filepath.</p>
    </div>
