                These are the static libraries made with MSVC, so if you're using another compiler, it's likely you'll need
                to compile the JBON <a href = "https://github.com/Zanic23/JBON-2.0" target="_blank">source files</a> on your 
                own. To use the downloads above in visual studio, begin by extracting them somewhere on your computer. 
                In your C++ project, go to your project's properties and under C/C++ go to the general settings, and click 
                "Additional Include Directories". There, search for where you saved the extracted JBON file and the directory 
                to the 'include' folder you just downloaded. Next go to the 'Linker' settings right below C/C++ and click general
                settings. Under 'Additional Library Directories', add the filepath to the 'lib' folder from the JBON file.
                Finally, still under the linker settings, go to 'Input' and click 'Additional Dependencies'. From There,
                simply type 'JBON.lib'. To use JBON in your project, do #include "JBON.h".
